Known bugs for the Android port:

 * The configure script will fail if clang is not installed, even though
   it is not needed for the Android build. 
   The workaround is to make sure clang is available in your $PATH.

 * The configure script for libdispatch will call pkg-config to search 
   for libkqueue. As a workaround, you can run 
   'sudo aptitude install libkqueue-dev' to bring in the .pc file. 
   This might also happen with libpthread_workqueue.
