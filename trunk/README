Building OpenGCD for Android
----------------------------

Make sure to read the BUGS file for any bugs pertaining to the Android platform.

  1. Download the Android NDK revision 8e from here:
     http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html

  2. Install the Android NDK under /opt.

  3. Download the Android Developer Tools (ADT) bundle version 20130219:
     http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

  4. Install the ADT bundle under /opt. 

  5. Run the OpenGCD configure script and provide the paths to your NDK and SDK.
     Example:

     ./configure --host=arm-linux-androideabi \
               --with-ndk=/opt/android-ndk-r8e \
               --with-sdk=/opt/adt-bundle-linux-x86_64-20130219/sdk

       **NOTE** The path to the SDK depends on what OS you are using,
                the above example is for a 64-bit Linux host.

  6. Build libdispatch

        make

     **** NOTE: this currently fails due to problems with the
        generated libdispatch-197/config/config.h. You need to edit this file
        and append the following lines:

#define  HAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME 1
#define  HAVE_DECL_CLOCK_MONOTONIC 1
#define  HAVE_DECL_PROGRAM_INVOCATION_SHORT_NAME 1

  7. Run the unit tests

        make check

Debugging
---------

To run one of the test programs under the debugger, follow these steps:

   1. Run the "make debug" target and set the BINARY variable to the
      path to the binary. Example:
   
        make debug BINARY=obj/local/armeabi/dispatch-api
